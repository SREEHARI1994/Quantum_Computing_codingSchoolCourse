# Quantum_Computing_codingSchoolCourse
I am currently attending the Introduction to Quantum Computing Course with IBM Quantum conducted by Coding School https://www.qubitbyqubit.org/programs.
This course involves weekly homework submissions. The homeworks assignments for the initial weeks dealt purely with mathematics and we were advised to use a calculator. You can call me crazy, but I absolutely love python and hence prefers writing python code  to pressing the calculator keys.So maybe it took more time than doing on calculator, but I felt happy doing the math heavy homeworks of initial weeks entirely in python.The Python script files I used for the hw's have been shared here and any other Python files I use as a part of this course in future will also be shared here under a different folder. Please note that for hw scripts currently pushed here, except for weeks 7 and week1, week numbers have not been put correctly but they do contain the codes I used for week2 to week 4 homeworks. I am only posting here the mostly indirect solutions to homeworks that are way past deadlines and hence I believe that I am not in violation of any honor code.
